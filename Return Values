Functions can produce two kinds of outputs:

Return Values: Some value a function can pass to program to use later on in code
- Make sure to store the return value in a variable

Side Effects: Anything else that gets changed while function is running.

emoticon = "V.V"

def main():
    global emoticon            #Can utilize global in order to modify emoticon which is a global variable
    say("Is anyone there?")
    emoticon = ":D"
    say("Oh, hi!")

def say(phrase):
    print(phrase + " " + emoticon)


main()
