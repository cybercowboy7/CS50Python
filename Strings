- String is a sequence of characters

- Create string via : 'Hello, World' OR "Hello, World"

- Escaping:
  mystring = 'It\'s an escaped quote!'
  mystring2 = "I'm a so-called \"script kiddie\""

- Multiline strings
  '''This is line 1,
  this is line 2,
  this is line 3.'''

- Escaped Sequences:
  \n	    A newline (Newlines are generated with your return key). Advances to the next
  \r	    Carriage return: takes you back to the start of the line, without advancing to the next line
  \t	    A tab character
  \\	    The slash character itself: because it is used as the start of escape sequences, we must escape this character, too. Python is quite forgiving if you forget to escape it, though.

- String operations:
  - in the REPL utilize mystring. and then hit tab to see a list of all sting operations

  - Refer to docs for all string operations: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

- Python string formatting with f-strings
  - example: 
my_age = 40
f'My age is {my_age}'
  - The f tells python to scan the string for curly braces. Inside the braces, we can put any python expression we want.


- Quickly printing a variable:
  name = "John"
  age = 56
  print(f"{name=}, {age=}")
